## Past Chairman's Message (2016, 2017)

![Dr. MLN](/user/img/people/dr-mln.png)

Dear Section Members,

Wish You all Happy and Prosperous New Year 2018.

I am pleased to inform you that the activities of Hyderabad Section held during the year of 2017. In all, the year 2017 has been a very eventful year in which all technical societies chapters have actively conducted good number of events. The future directions committee (FDC) has recommended a set of goals for the Section in line with Vision and Mission which we have already informed you in the previous edition of the Newsletter. These are towards knowledge sharing, networking and career development so that IEEE Hyderabad Section can sustain itself as a high performing Section at the IEEE global level. All stakeholders organizing events henceforth are requested to keep these goals in view. The need for an interactive Website had been a long-standing requirement of Hyderabad section. With the efforts of Mr. P.V.S. Maruthi Rao, the Section website has been revamped and is ready for release shortly. I am confident that this website grows into a full-fledged one over the next few months. The Section has established Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) Society Chapter by adding with existing Computational Intelligence Society (CIS Chapter forming CIS/GRSS Joint Society Chapter. With this, the Section represents sixteen technical societies with nine chapters.

The Section membership reveals that there is large potential to form Chapter(s) with Aerospace and Electronic Systems (AES), Robotics & Automation and Vehicular Technology Societies. I am sure this could be taken up in near future. The CAS/EDS, CIS/GRSS, MTT/AP/EMC Chapters were able to garner support funds from their respective parent Societies to organize special projects / events. This way, for instance, CASS/EDS Chapter could organize a three day workshop for improving IEEE CASS membership in Indonesia reaching out to 13 universities from various parts of Indonesia. As part of the CASS networking program, the Chapter team has visited Sri Lanka Section to spread awareness on CAS society. Further, Region 10 has partially supported the organization of WIE and Education Society Chapter events.

I appreciate all Chapters and Affinity Groups of the Section for having organized number of technical events to qualify the Section as an Outstanding Large Section. I am happy to note that this year Section/Chapter flagship events: Faraday Memorial
Lecture, Section Student Congress, John McCarthy Memorial Lecture, and Sir J. C. Bose Memorial lecture organized in this
quarter were well attended. I am glad to observe that the Vizag Bay Subsection and Guntur Subsection have also reported good activities in this last quarter. The Warangal zone has been contributing significantly with very encouraging participation in all the events conducted in the area. I strongly believe that the Society Chapters are well qualified to organize and host high quality IEEE Conferences, and I urge all Chapter Chairs to plan for conferences in the near future to cater to the needs of the local IEEE fraternity. A very important aspect of organizing a conference is maintaining high quality in terms of paper selection and scrupulous scrutiny in terms of plagiarism. In all, I feel that the past two years have been very eventful and thank the Section ExCom and Volunteers of Slate 2016 & Slate 2017 for having done wonderfully well in terms of organizing activities at international and national level creating a niche for the IEEE Hyderabad Section. I wish that the Section grows to unprecedented heights in the future. Finally, I appreciate the efforts of Mr. Rajagopalan Kannan and Dr. Mohammed Arifuddin Sohel for bringing out this edition of Section Newsletter.

All the best to all volunteers for their future endeavours.

## IEEE Hyderabad Section at a glance
---

On 13 May 1884 a few electrical engineers in New York met to form the American Institute of Electrical Engineers which later became IEEE. By a co-incidence exactly a hundred years later, on 13 May 1984 a few members of IEEE formed a Section of IEEE at Hyderabad. This Section was formed by upgrading what used to be the IEEE Hyderabad Subsection that was formed in
mid 1981 with just 25 members with the initiative of Mr C Satish (now a Life Senior Member), Group. Capt. Siva Swamy was the Chairman of subsection. Dr V Prasad Kodali, who was elected as Region 10 Director in that year gave much encouragement for the formation of Hyderabad section. The Subsection and the Section had a unique set of volunteers of merit and dedication especially in the 1980s. the section grew slowly due to the hard work of Gp. Capt Siva Swami, Prof B L Deekshatulu, C. Satish, B.S. Nagaraja et al. Prof. B L Deekshatulu was the first Chairman of the Section in 1984 who is now Life Fellow of IEEE.

The Section has been very active from right from its Subsection days. The Subsection’s first continuing education program was a course on “Signal Processing” held on 9 and 10 September 1981. The first short course by the Section was on “Secure Communications” from 13 to 22 December 1984 which drew over 100 attendees. Incidentally our section we conducted 32 continuing education programs in the first two decades. Even in formation of Society Chapters , Hyderabad Section has shown a tremendous efforts. In the early 1990s the first Chapter PES / IAS / PELS Joint Chapter was formed. Few years later a Computer Society Chapter and then a EMC/MTT/AES Joint Chapter were formed.

Today there are 9 chapters and 2 Affinity Groups and our Section.
